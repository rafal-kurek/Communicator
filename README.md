# Communicator
An instant messenger written in Javascript with an emoticon library on a client side and PHP on a server side. The instant messenger uses MySQL database to store messages. AJAX long polling is looking for new messages in the database all the time and if it finds one it sends them to all users. Users can send messages and read them from other users. Additionally the application deletes very old messages from the database to prevent data redundancy in the database.
